**This file only pertains to the Parrot OS MiniTower with 3.5" LCD display,** 
**it does not apply to models without a 3.5" LCD display.**

3.5” Display Options

You cannot use both the 3.5” display and an HDMI connected monitor at the same time.  

If you want to use the 3.5” display then do not connect HDMI.  Simply provide power and the MiniTower will boot to a terminal on the 3.5” display.  

If you want to use a monitor then connect the monitor with an HDMI cable (included) and provide power to the MiniTower.   The system will boot to a full desktop on the monitor you connected.  While the HDMI is connected the 3.5” display will remain white.  This is normal.
